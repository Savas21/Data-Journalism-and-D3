### Background
In this project, I'm analyzing the trends shaping people's lives back to 2014, as well as creating charts, graphs and interactives to help understand the findings. The data we're using collected from [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) and the [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-2014-Overall/5ra3-ixqq).
